	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<pre>
		Chocolate Cake:
			▢Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
			▢Grease four 8 or 9" round cake pans and dust with cocoa powder. Line bottoms with parchment paper. Set Aside.
			▢Add all the dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Stir to combine on low speed.
			▢In a medium bowl, using a hand mixer, whisk eggs with oil, buttermilk, espresso, vanilla, cherry liqueur, melted chocolate, once combined, slowly whisk in the hot water, careful not to cook the eggs.
			▢Add wet ingredients to the bowl with dry ingredients and mix on medium speed for 2-3 mins. Batter will be very thin.
				▢Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.
			▢Bake for 25-30 mins in the preheated oven or until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out mostly clean.
			▢Cool the cakes 10 minutes in the pans then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.
		Cherry Liqueur Syrup:
			▢Place sugar and water into a small pot over medium heat and stir to bring to a boil.
			▢Simmer for 1 min then remove from heat and stir in cherry liqueur, after that add the cherries. Allow to cool completely before using it.
			▢Once cooled, remove the cherries from the syrup and place in a bowl.
		Whipped Cream Frosting:
			▢Prepare the whipped cream when you are ready to assemble the cake.
			▢Add cream and sugar to a very cold bowl and whip until stiff peaks form.
			▢Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
		Assemble the Cake:
			▢Flatten the chocolate layers.
			▢On a cake stand, place a dollop of whipped cream and add on top one chocolate cake layer. Brush generously with the cooled cherry syrup.
			▢Top with about 1 cup of cold whipped cream and spread it evenly.
			▢Top with about 1 cup of cherries and gently press them into the whipped cream.
			▢Repeat with remaining layers.
			▢When done frost the outside of the cake and top of the cake with whipped cream.
			▢If needed, make more whipped cream and pipe rosettes on top of the cake. Garnish each rosette with one maraschino cherry.
			▢Decorate the sides of the cake chocolate shavings or chocolate bark.
			▢Chill for 12 hours before serving.</pre>
